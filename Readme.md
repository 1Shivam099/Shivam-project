# Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform

## Project Title
**Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform with Collaborative Storytelling via NFTs**

## Project Description
The **Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform** is a decentralized platform designed for collaborative storytelling where each chapter is tokenized as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Users can create chapters as NFTs, which represent parts of a larger story. Each chapter has unique content, an associated author, and a reward system for creators. The platform allows users to create, own, transfer, and trade chapters. Authors can earn rewards by creating and sharing their story chapters. The chapters are stored on the blockchain as NFTs, ensuring ownership and the ability to transfer them.

**Contract Address**: 0x0A8618CC04D7bec09D43e45ff64C4F7c5Cc1E681

## Project Vision
The **Learn-to-Earn** platform envisions a new era of collaborative storytelling and decentralized content creation, where creators can earn rewards for contributing chapters to stories. By leveraging the power of NFTs, the platform ensures true ownership of the digital content, enabling a vibrant marketplace for story chapters. The goal is to build a decentralized ecosystem where authors, readers, and collectors can participate in collaborative content creation and ownership.

## Key Features
- **Chapter Creation**: Creators can create story chapters, which are represented as NFTs. Each chapter is linked to its content and has an associated reward for the author.
  
- **Ownership and Transfer**: Each chapter is owned by the creator when minted. The ownership of chapters can be transferred to other users or collectors via the blockchain.

- **Reward System**: Authors receive a reward (in Ether) for each chapter they create. This incentivizes creators to contribute to the platform and share their stories.
  
- **NFT Representation**: Each story chapter is represented as an NFT on the blockchain, allowing for true ownership and the ability to trade or sell chapters.

- **Public Access to Chapters**: Anyone can view the content of any chapter by providing the chapter ID. However, only the author or owner can transfer or claim rewards for the chapter.

- **Decentralized & Transparent**: All chapters and transactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and decentralization.
